# End of Year Dev Web Project: Guitar Chords and Songs Library

## Overview
We had many programming projects, but this one was special for me. We had the freedom to use our ideas for both content and design. I wasn't obliged to use this much content, but I was really into this project because I had a clear visualization of the idea in my head.

## Design
- **Logo and other:** Each element is custom-made by me using Adobe Illustrator

## Theme
Guitar playing has been my hobby since a year. I wanted to create a place to keep chords and songs. Yes, there are many sites like this, but mine is totally customized. I can stock only the songs I want to play or don't want to forget.

## Structure
- **Header:** Includes logo and navigation
- **Main Page:** A long page showcasing all site possibilities to keep visitors interested, with buttons for navigation and interactive chord knowledge checks
- **Learn Chords Page:** A large library of chords with sounds for the main chords
- **Songs Library Page:** A collection of songs. Click on a song to see a player with an album picture, chords, lyrics, and rhythm details
- **Info Page:** Layouts of the site for my professors
- **Footer:** Includes social media links, present on each page

## Responsive Design
Worked mostly in vw units to create this level of design. There are many changes for the mobile version to ensure a great experience on all devices.

## Note
I don't know my grade out of 20 yet, but I will update this file with the result!
